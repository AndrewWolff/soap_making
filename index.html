   <h2>Types of Soap</h2>
    <p>Here at Quality Sudzs, we formulate, develop, and handcraft a perfect soap for you and your body. After no people are the same, so why wash your body with a cookie-cutter name brand soap when you could be washing your body with high-quality soap. Our soap isn't just right for you; it will also leave you smelling great all day long.</p>

    <p>Currently, we have two ways of producing the highest quality soap. The first process is hot processed soap, and the second is cold processed. Whatever your preference is, we have a large number of all-natural sents that can be added to both.</p>
